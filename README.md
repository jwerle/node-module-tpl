Node Module Template
============

### Setup
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jwerle/node-module-tpl.git my_module
$ cd my_app
```

You are going to want to remove the remote origin from the repository. 
You can do this by doing the following from the module directory:
```
$ git remote rm origin 
```

If you already have a remote set up you can go ahead and add it by doing
the following the module directory:
```
$ git remote add origin git://git@myserver.com:/path/to/repo.git
```

# There you go! You have a pretty basic node module template
